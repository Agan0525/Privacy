          <h3 class="mb-4">9. Payment Terms</h3>
            <h5 class="important_text">9.1. In-App purchases</h5>
            <p>RainGame may license to you certain virtual goods to be used within the Apps and which you may purchase with real cash or which you may earn or redeem via gameplay (Virtual Items). When you obtain such Virtual Items from RainGame or its authorized designee, you receive a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to use such Virtual Items within the applicable App and solely for non-commercial use.</p>
            <p>RainGame may manage, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, RainGame reserves the right at any time to impose additional terms or conditions on your use of Virtual Items. Such additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement. Your continued use of the App will be deemed acceptance thereof. If we need to contact you about your Virtual Items or your account, you consent to receive the notices by email. You acknowledge and agree that any such notices that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements.</p>
            <p>The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, except where expressly authorized in the Apps, if any.</p>
            <p>Virtual Items have no monetary value and are not currency or property. Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real cash and do not act as a substitute for real world money. Virtual Items cannot be sold, traded, transferred, or exchanged for cash. Virtual Items may only be redeemed for certain gameplay entitlements that may be made available within the App from time to time. Neither RainGame nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. RainGame has no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.</p>
            <p>Price and availability of Virtual Items are subject to change without notice.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise required by law, all purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through the App or Services are final and non-refundable, and you are not entitled to a refund for any unused Virtual Items. Once you redeem a Virtual Item for a gameplay entitlement within the App or Services, such gameplay entitlement is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable. You acknowledge and consent that the provision of Virtual Items for use in connection with the App or Services is a process that commences immediately upon purchase and you forfeit your right of withdrawal once the performance has started.</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise required by law, you agree that RainGame is not required to provide a refund for Virtual Items for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, whether your loss of license under this Agreement was voluntary or involuntary.</p>
            <p>If you request your personal data to be erased as specified in RainGames Privacy Policy, you will permanently and without a right to a refund lose all of your Virtual Items as RainGame can no longer associate such Virtual Items with you.</p>
            <p class="important_text">EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT RainGame IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND TO YOU FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN YOU DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT, YOUR ACCOUNT IS TERMINATED, OR WHEN YOU CEASE TO USE THE APP OR SERVICES.</p>
            <h5 class="important_text">9.2. Subscriptions</h5>
            <p>Some of RainGames Apps may offer subscription-based Services. If you purchase a subscription, then by clicking the purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services immediately and you are entering into a monthly subscription contract with RainGame. You are also authorizing a charge to you on a recurring basis of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the time of purchase. By purchasing a subscription, we will automatically charge on a recurring basis the payment method associated with your account. For subscription Services purchased in a RainGame App played on a platform such as Apple or Google, the applicable platform will charge you for the subscription fee and the platforms payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platforms payment terms for additional information.</p>
            <p>Trial subscriptions are offered free of charge for a certain period of time from activation specified in the relevant trial offer in the App. If you do not cancel the subscription within such trial period, the trial subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription for the fees and for the subscription period set out in the App at the time of the activation of the trial period. You may cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the subscription setting of your account. Any paid subscription you activate begins immediately from the activation of such paid subscription and not after the expiration of any trial period. Any unused trial period will therefore be forfeited if a subscription is activated prior to the expiration of such trial period.</p>
            <p>Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews, otherwise payment of the subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing RainGame with valid credit card or payment account details for payment of all fees. In case the subscription fee cannot be taken from your account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reason, your subscription will be automatically cancelled.</p>
            <p>Subscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. If you are using a local currency, the actual amount may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates without notice to you. The charges will be applied to the payment instrument or method you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different payment instrument or method, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change. If we make a change to the monthly subscription rate in U.S. Dollars, we will notify you of such change in advance.</p>
            <p>Once you have purchased a subscription, you cannot cancel your subscription for the current subscription period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a subscription. However, you may cancel your subscription for the next subscription period as follows: you can manage and cancel your subscription at any time in your Account Settings of your device. For iOS subscriptions, please see Apples support page <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039</a>. For Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Plays support page <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en-GB&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid.</a></p>
            <p>Except where required by applicable law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
            <p>RainGame in its sole discretion and at any time may modify the subscription fee. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. You will be provided reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fee. If you do not take action to agree to the increase in subscription fee, your subscription shall expire at the end of the then-current subscription period.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-4">19. Arbitration Agreement.</h3>
            <p>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.</p>
            <p>You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, Disputes) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a partys copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one persons claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. This Dispute Resolution section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</span>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the AAA Rules) then in effect, except as modified by this Dispute Resolution section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/arbitration">https://www.adr.org/arbitration.</a>) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Arbitration Process.</span>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules at <a href="https://www.adr.org/arbitration">https://www.adr.org/arbitration.</a> The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAAs roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Arbitration Location and Procedure.</span>Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Arbitrators Decision.</span>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrators decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrators award damages must be consistent with the terms of the Limitation of Liability section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimants individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. RainGame will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Fees.</span>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Changes.</span>Notwithstanding the provisions of the Changes to the Term or Services section above, if we change this Dispute Resolution section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="mailto:marketing@RainGame.com">marketing@RainGame.com</a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the Last Updated Date above or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and us in accordance with the provisions of this Dispute Resolution section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
            <p><span class="important_text">Severability and Survival.</span>If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
